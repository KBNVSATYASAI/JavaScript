In this we have created a sample project on "HTML DOM". BY using DOM we can able to manipulate the html and css by users and by browser actions.And what is DOM? Means it is a structured thing in browser when you have upload your html files to your browser.And "Document" is the starting node for tree.In tree we have no.of nodes (or) objects.And with in the Document we have so many methods like ----> ".getElementById()" etc.......... And in this we have created a basic events also.Firstly we have that WHAT IS AN EVENT IN JS?------>Event means the action performing by users.And we use basic event in this example that is "onClick()".When you click on the attribute which is specified by the onClick() event it performs the specific function awarded in js.

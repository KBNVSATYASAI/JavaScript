The following Counterapp Was Created by using a some basic concepts of html,css and javaScript. And the topics are 
In javaScript--------->1)Primitive DataTypes
                       1.0)Number->	All the numbers are of Number type.
                       1.1)String->String is a stream of characters. The String should be enclosed with Single quotes, Double quotes, or Backticks.
                       1.2)Boolean->Boolean values are either true or false.
                       1.3->Undefined->If a value is not assigned to the variable, then it takes undefined as its value. In JS, undefined refers to the value that is not being assigned.
And one more method we need to know is "The typeof() operator is used to find the type of value."
example:-
        let a = 900;
let b = 9.2;
console.log(typeof(a));  // number
console.log(typeof(b));  // number
                       2)ANd one more method is "The parseInt() function accepts a string and converts it into an integer."
Example:-
        let a = '20';
console.log(typeof(a));  // string  

let b = parseInt(a);
console.log(typeof(b));  // number

3)Conditional Statements:-"The Conditional Statement allows you to execute a block of code only when a specific condition is true."

By Using these concepts we have created this counterapp.
